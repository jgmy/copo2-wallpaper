Snowflake active wallpaper for android

## What does this script
This is a processing script. You can compile it in processing using Android Mode. You can also compile it in APDE (Android Processing). Be sure to choose "Wallpaper" as output.

## Why do I make a git for such simple script.
I had found that making an android live wallaper for android is very simple, but making a live wallpaper configuration menu work is not. So having a good example online would help me create new live wallpapers.
